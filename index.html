                <h5> What is Bish-Bosh?</h5>
                Bish-Bosh lists all numbers between 1 and 100, with some exceptions.
                    If the number is evenly divisible with 3, 'Bish' is listed instead of the number. 
                    If the number is evenly divisible by 4, 'Bosh' is listed instead the number. 
                    If the number is evenly divisible by both 3 and 4, 
                    "Bish-Bosh" is written instead of the number.
